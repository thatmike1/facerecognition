# Face Recognition App

This is a simple face recognition application built with React. The application uses the Clarifai API to detect faces in images. It also includes a user interface for inputting the image URL and displaying the image with the detected face highlighted.
Getting Started



## The app includes several other components for displaying the user interface:

The main application logic is contained in src/App.js. This component maintains the application state and includes methods for handling user input and making requests to the Clarifai API.

- `Header`: Displays the application header.
- `Rank`: Displays the user's rank.
- `FaceRecognition`: Displays the image and the detected face.
- `ImageLinkForm`: Provides a form for the user to input the image URL.

## Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
